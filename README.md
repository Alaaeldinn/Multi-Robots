# Multi-Robots for Unknown Environments Exploration and Mapping

## Overview 

In our fast-paced world, integrating multi-robot systems, including mobile robots and drones, is increasingly vital. Our project focuses on leveraging L-SLAM and V-SLAM methodologies to achieve groundbreaking outcomes in exploring and mapping unknown environments.

## üèóÔ∏è Integration of AGV and Tello Drone:

The integration of an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) and a Tello drone showcases our commitment to utilizing multi-robot systems. This enhances exploration efficiency by enabling seamless communication and collaboration between the AGV and drone. The drone shares maps and localization data with the AGV, optimizing aerial path planning for comprehensive environment mapping.

## ü§ñ Robot Localization and Mapping:

Implemented HECTOR SLAM on real-time LIDAR data for precise robot localization and mapping. Additionally, we've utilized RTAB Mapping on ZED2I Camera and ORB-SLAM3 on Tello drone for comprehensive mapping capabilities.

## üëÅÔ∏è Object Detection and Depth Estimation:

Incorporating cutting-edge technologies like YOLO-NAS and MiDAS enhances our robots' perception abilities significantly, providing robust object detection and depth estimation.

## üõ©Ô∏è Aerial Path Planning:

Beyond ground robotics, our project seamlessly integrates multiple path planning methodologies, enhancing the efficiency of aerial exploration for drones.

## ü§ù Flexibility and Scalability:

Our achievement lies in designing a system that supports the adaptability and scalability of robotic teams. We've successfully incorporated mini-robots to explore environments that a mobile robot alone can't access.
